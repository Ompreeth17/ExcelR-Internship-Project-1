Project: Energy Prediction Model for Combined Cycle Power Plant

Business Objective: Developed a predictive model to estimate energy production in a combined-cycle power plant, which utilizes gas turbines, steam turbines, and heat recovery steam generators to optimize energy output. The model aims to predict energy generation based on key ambient and operational variables, providing insights to enhance plant performance.

Data Details: The dataset includes 9,568 observations over six years, capturing real-world metrics from a fully loaded power plant. Variables include:

Temperature (Â°C)
Exhaust Vacuum (cm Hg)
Ambient Pressure (millibar)
Relative Humidity (%)
Energy Production (MW - net hourly output)
Methodology: Built a regression model to accurately predict energy output based on environmental and operational inputs, helping optimize efficiency in energy production.

Milestones & Deployment: Successfully developed and deployed the model using Flask/Streamlit to provide real-time, interactive energy output predictions.

Impact: The model supports decision-making in energy management, enabling better forecasting and operational adjustments for improved power plant efficiency.
